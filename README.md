# Credit Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple credit calculator implemented as a modal window using
React. It was developed as a test task to demonstrate skills in building
interactive UI components with Create React App. The calculator allows users to
input loan parameters and calculate repayment details, styled according to a
provided Figma design.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Follow the
instructions below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArinaTer/credit-calculator-tz.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-calculator-tz
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the
app. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build will be generated in the `build` folder, ready for deployment. It
includes minified files and hashed filenames for optimal performance.

### Testing

To run the test suite in interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

See the
[Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more details.

### Ejecting (Optional)

If you need full control over the configuration:

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. It exposes all configuration files and
dependencies, allowing customization but removing the simplicity of Create React
App.

## Deployment

To deploy the app (e.g., to GitHub Pages), follow these steps:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the contents of the `build` folder. For GitHub Pages, refer to the
   [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## About the Project

This project features a modal window with a credit calculator, built with React.
The work focused on:

- Creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Implementing basic loan calculation logic.
- Following a design mockup from Figma for styling and layout.

The calculator is a lightweight tool intended for demonstration purposes,
showcasing React component development and state management.
